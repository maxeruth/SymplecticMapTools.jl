# SymplecticMapTools.jl
This is a package devoted to different tools for analyzing (primarily 2D) symplectic maps. The implemented algorithms include 
1. The parameterization method for finding invariant circles [1]
2. The Birkhoff filter diagonalization method for finding invariant circles [2]
3. The reproducing kernel Hilber space based invariant level-set finding method [3]
