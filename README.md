# In Progress
We are currently working on updating the documentation and testing to include [2] below. 
If you want to try it sooner, you must install this package via cloning.
The functions `adaptive_birkhoff_extrapolation`, `get_w0!`, and `adaptive_get_torus!` can be used to compute the higher dimensional tori.

# SymplecticMapTools.jl
SymplecticMapTools is a package devoted to different tools for analyzing (primarily 2D)
symplectic maps. The overall goal of this package is to provide a set of tools
that can be used to robustly characterize orbits and find invariant structures
while being efficient in the number of evaluations of the map. If you have any
algorithms that you would like to see added, pull requests are welcome!

The implemented algorithms in this package include
1. The Birkhoff extrapolation method for finding invariant tori [1,2]
2. The reproducing kernel Hilbert space based invariant level-set finding method [3]
3. The implementations of the parameterization method for finding invariant
   circles and connecting orbits (see, e.g., [4] for an introduction to the
   parameterization method)
4. Newton's method with line search and BFGS for finding periodic orbits
Examples of how to use the code are found in `examples/`. These examples are
created using `Literate.jl` out of files found in `docs/`, and can be recreated
locally by running `docs/literate_examples.jl`. Additionally, these notebooks
are outputted to markdown and included in the documentation.

## Citation
To cite this package, we recommend you cite [1] or [2] for Birkhoff RRE, or [3] for the level set method.

## Installation
For installation, add the package from the general repository using the command
`]add SymplecticMapTools.jl` in the Julia REPL. 
This package uses Requires for plotting.
You must load CairoMakie or Plots separately to use the plotting functionality.

## Development
This is a new package, and things are changing rapidly! Currently, features
involving the InvariantCircle struct, the extrapolation algorithm, and
periodic orbits (1, 3, and 4 above) are mostly tested, with the features related
to (3) still in need of testing. More examples are being added as well.
