# SymplecticMapTools.jl
A package for analyzing symplectic maps, inspired by applications to plasma
confinement devices such as stellerators.

## Package Features
This package includes implementations of a variety of algorithms that are useful
for symplectic maps, including
- Finding invariant circles via extrapolation algorithms
- Sample-efficient approximations to invariant structures via a kernel method
- The weighted Birkhoff average
- Periodic orbit finding
- The parameterization method for invariant circles and heteroclinic
(connecting) orbits
